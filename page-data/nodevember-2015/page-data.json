It was a great experience overall and I'm grateful that I went. Since I've been wanting to be better with writing on my blog, I decided to take this opportunity to type up my thoughts and share them.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>One big thing that stands out is how well organized Nodevember was. Registration was simple and the signage was perfect. I never felt lost (except when trying to remember where the car was parked—but that’s my fault).</p>\n<p>The conference swag, both from the organizers and the sponsors, was awesome. I was very pleased with the stickers, tee shirts, and socks that I picked up. And there was a ton of other cool stuff that I didn't get.</p>\n<p>The food was unbelievable. Instead of the usual conference fare we were treated to high-quality meals that represented some of Nashville’s food culture. (Hot chicken? Heck yes!)</p>\n<p>There were also a lot of great things about the format. The low ticket price and weekend schedule make it very accessible. The 30-minute sessions felt just right to me—long enough to get at least a few nuggets but short enough to keep everything moving at a good clip throughout the day. The breaks in between were perfect for getting to the next session and even networking a little in between, although the lunch break felt just a tad too long to me.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>It is, of course, the content that really makes or breaks a conference. And with two days and multiple tracks there was plenty of it.</p>\n<p>To be honest, the opening keynote by Yehuda Katz was a huge disappointment. What started out as an interesting discussion of the merit of frameworks turned into an extended sales pitch for Ember. The “live-coding” video that made up most of the talk was almost impossible to read from where I was sitting. I really wish he had spent more time talking about frameworks as empowerment and skipped the Ember demo. It felt less like a keynote and more like what should have just been an Ember session at the conference.</p>\n<p>There were a couple of other \"sour notes\" as well. Some of the speakers badly ended what was otherwise a good session by continuing to take questions after their allotted times instead of dismissing the group and sticking around to answer questions one-on-one. Another speaker changed his topic but didn’t tell anyone until his time began, which was too late to make it to another talk.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, those (mostly) minor annoyances were more than made up for by the rest of the content. Here are a few of my highlights:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://twitter.com/reybango\">Rey Bango</a>’s openness and vulnerability about struggling to learn Node.js were very encouraging and engaging.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://twitter.com/robdel12\">Robert DeLuca</a>’s concept of “accessibility debt” was brilliant.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://twitter.com/supersole\">Soledad Penadés</a>’s second-day keynote about “Healthy Egotism” was a much-needed reminder for everyone about the importance of taking care of yourself.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://twitter.com/getify\">Kyle Simpson</a>’s talk about async programming and specifically CSP was mind-bending. I was excited to hear him speak in person.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://twitter.com/Aimee_Knight\">Aimee Knight</a>’s talk about lessons learned since graduating from NSS was awesome and plenty useful for all skill levels.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://twitter.com/seldo\">Laurie Voss</a> from npm gave an excellent overview of SOA that was useful whether you’re working with Node or not.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<p>This has been an interesting year for conferences in Middle Tennessee. With the demise of both DevLink and Coderfaire (at least for now) and the start of <a href=\"http://www.musiccitycode.com\">Music City Code</a>, the landscape has really shifted. Fortunately, Music City Code came out of the gate strong—in fact, it was so polished that it didn’t really feel like a first-year conference to me. And this year’s Nodevember was truly impressive, both compared to what they did last year and to what anyone would have reasonably expected for a second year. I think we’re very fortunate here in Nashville and I’m excited to see how our community continues to grow.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Nodevember 2015","date":"November 20, 2015"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/nodevember-2015/"}}}

WordPress (self-hosted). A built-from-scratch Rails app. Tumblr.

*UPDATE*: I forgot LiveJournal and Xanga, which were my first two, respectively.

Those are the blogging solutions I've tried in the past. Now I'm adding [Octopress](http://octopress.org) (via [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com)) to that list. It's a great platform for someone like me--easy to use but nerdy enough to be fun. It also fulfills my desire to "[write from home](http://adactio.com/journal/6632/)."

Of course, the real problem with all of my past attempts to have a blog is never making it much further than an inaugural post like this. I start with the best of intentions, but without clear goals and a clear direction I falter, abandoning the blog with only a handful of posts.

I think that part of the reason for that is because I have never clearly defined what my blog would be about. In creating a space that might work for anything I end up doing nothing instead. I'm paralyzed by the luxury of choice.

That is the key difference this time. I'm going to focus on my career, one of my greatest joys. I love to learn and I want to be better about sharing what I learn. I think that this can be a great format for doing so if I'll commit to it.

My free time is spoken for at the moment, dedicated to a project that I'm looking forward to talking about here soon. But within the next month my goal is to start posting at least once a week about topics in the aforementioned field. If that sounds like a good time to you, I hope you'll join me here. And please feel free to harass me on [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/{{site.username}}) and keep me accountable.

My preference is to keep each commit as small as possible while still providing some kind of value, i.e. <a href=\"http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html\">deliver working software frequently</a>. But occasionally I will have already started into another feature before getting the first one committed. Or worse, sometimes I'll be in the middle of one task and notice a bug or opportunity for enhancement that I just go ahead and address. In either case, now my working copy is a mixture of what should really be two separate commits.</p>\n<p>Savvy Git users already know that you can stage everything or just specific files using <code>git add &#x3C;pathspec></code>. But what if you've made multiple changes within the same file and you don't want to stage all of them? Fortunately, there is a way to stage only the changes that you want to commit.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://git-scm.com/docs/git-add\"><code>git-add</code></a> command accepts a <code>--patch</code> (or <code>-p</code>) flag that allows you to review each diff and decide whether to stage it or not. Stepping through the file(s), at each point where there is a diff you can choose to either skip that change, stage it, break it down into a smaller hunk, or a number of other actions.</p>\n<p>Changes that are in separate parts of a file work especially well with patch mode--Git has a harder time separating diffs that are very close together. In those cases you have to make a call about whether the changes really need to be separate, and require manual editing, or if it's logical for them to be released together.</p>\n<p>With features like patch (just one part of <code>git-add</code>'s <a href=\"http://git-scm.com/docs/git-add#_interactive_mode\">interactive mode</a>), Git makes it possible to set up each commit exactly the way that you want.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Git Tips: Setting the Stage","date":"July 10, 2014"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/git-tips-setting-the-stage/"}}}

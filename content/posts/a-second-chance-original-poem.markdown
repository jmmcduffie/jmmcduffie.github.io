A stirring\
An awakening\
A rebirth.\
But at the same time\
A death\
A relinquishment\
An abandonment.

A fire\
Both cleansing\
And strengthening.\
A light\
Both shattering darkness\
And showing the way.

A voice\
A call\
A song.\
My soul rises up and\
An answer\
A cry\
A charge.

Life renewed\
Empowered\
Given new purpose.\
A second chance.
